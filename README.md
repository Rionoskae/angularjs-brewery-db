## Brewery DB AngularJS Demo

This repository is used for experimenting with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Brewery DB](http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/). It pulls in a random beer when configured.

### Configuring

Copy the `config.php-dist` file to `config.php` and insert your Brewery DB API Key.
